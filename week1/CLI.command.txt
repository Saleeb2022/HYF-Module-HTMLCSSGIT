Q1: How do I creat a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
A1: first I have to create a file by executing $ mkdir hyf (or any other name for the folder). $ mkdir allows you to make a new directory.
then executing $ touch command.txt (to creat a txt empty folder)
then executing $ mv to move (move or rename file or directory) to  the mean file witch is I have already created and named it hyf.
To display the file in the CLI: by executing $ ls (to print or view all the files, and directories including the hiddden).

Q2: How do I creat multiple nested directories, like  /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
A2: $mkdir /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun. (mkdir allows you to creat filles).

Q3: How do I append a message to a file, without a newline charachter, so the output would be: 
first message
second message 
A3: $ touch comments.txt (creating a new empty file)
$ echo first message > comments.txt
$ echo second message >> comments.txt
$ cat comments.txt (tp print the content of the file ).
