Q1: How do I creat a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

A1: first I have to create a file by executing $ mkdir hyf (or any other name for the folder). $ mkdir allows you to make a new directory.                                                                    To creat a hidden file bassh I have to put a . before the name of the file. 


To display the file in the CLI: by executing $ ls (to print or view all the files). do display the hidden files I have to excute $is -a.
